## Alembic Migrations

At present the Alembic migrations are applied to a `kanoe.db` file in the `database/` folder. So you'll need to move the file to that location first.

Commands used:

- `alembic revision -m "..."` — An empty migration.
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."` — Autogenerated from changes to classes.
- `alembic upgrade head`
- `alembic current`
- `alembic history`
